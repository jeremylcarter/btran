This directory contains the libraries that need to be linked
against the converted BASIC to C++ programs, as well as the
associated header files.

Some VMS functionality is included in the libvms library and
associated include files for use under Linux, but it is not
fully compatible with the actual VMS ibraries. They are only
functional enough to allow me to convert specific programs,
as well as using std::string instead of descriptors. Hand
editing of the c++ files are probably necessry when using this
library.
