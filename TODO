Things that need working on.

parse.h - copy from parse.hh in makefile

Clean up #include at start of generated code.
	Lose those no longer used.
	Make sure includes for boost are Ok.

MAP,RECORD, etc.
	Code is currently buggy.

Built in functions.
	Need to use standard C++ and BOOST versions.

Testing/Debugging

lib routines
	Brig current with btran sources.

String and other library functions
	Use host features where available.
	EDIT$$(CVT$$). Handle boost routines better when multiple bits are set.
