src2 is for an updated version of the basic to C++ trabslator.

This is preliminary work, and currently does not do anything yet.

Requirements

	G++ or clang
	automake
	autoconf
	libtool
	make
	libboost
	ncurses

Reason for new version

	Clean up the code.

		The original version is a heavily modified trial and error
		version. Some things are done in a very odd way because of
		historical reasons.

		There is also a lot of things neing done in very inconsistant
		ways. The "Nde" structure is overcomplex.

		The parser uses the Node structure for too many things. Every
		token starts out as a node, and many have to be deleted. There
		is probably a latge number f memory leaks.

	Handle parsing better

		Current version will parse a lot of code that it shuld not.
		Errors are handled poorly. Maps and records are barely handled
		at al.

	Better variable tables.

		Variable tables are a mess in the original. Handling them
		properly will greatly simplify things.
		Variable types are also a mess (var/function, data type,
		parameters, etc.)

	Handle local functions (DEF FN) better.

		These functions need to be levereged up into the function
		that they are contained in.

		Calls outside of the functions will probably still be a
		problem.

	Use newer tols

		Flexc++ and bisonc++.

	Learn newer C++ standards.

		I want to learn more current C++ functionality that has been
		added to the standards over the years.

	Hopefully this newer version will be able to handle
